## Introduction

**Computer Use** is an open-source [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server — a computer-use agent (CUA) backend — that lets any coding agent use your computer the way a person does. It reads the screen through accessibility trees, clicks and types **in the background** so your mouse stays yours, shows an agent pointer where it is working, zooms in on small text, and drives tabs in your signed-in Chrome — on **macOS, Windows and Linux**.

**Works with Claude Code, Codex, Cursor and [MT Code](https://munimtech.com/mt-code)**, or any other MCP client, with any model — no vision model is required for interaction.

**Built by [Munim Technologies](https://munimtech.com/computer-use)** as the Computer Use engine of MT Code, and published here on its own.

## Quick start

1. Download the latest binary for your platform from [Releases](https://github.com/munimtechnologies/munim-computer-use/releases/latest) (`munim-computer-use-macos-universal.zip`, `munim-computer-use-windows-x64.zip`) or [build from source](#build-from-source).
2. Put it somewhere on your `PATH` (`/usr/local/bin/munim-computer-use`, or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\munim-computer-use\munim-computer-use.exe`).
3. macOS only: run `munim-computer-use request-permissions` once to be prompted for Accessibility and Screen Recording.
4. Register it with your agent:

```sh
# Claude Code — fastest: the npm launcher fetches the signed binary on first run
claude mcp add munim-computer-use -- npx -y munim-computer-use
# or point at a downloaded binary
claude mcp add munim-computer-use -- /usr/local/bin/munim-computer-use
```

```toml
# Codex — ~/.codex/config.toml
[mcp_servers.munim-computer-use]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "munim-computer-use"]
```

```json
// Cursor — .cursor/mcp.json
{ "mcpServers": { "munim-computer-use": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "munim-computer-use"] } } }
```

Then ask: _"Open Safari, find the cheapest flight to Denver on Tuesday and put it in a note."_ The agent reads the UI with `get_app_state`, acts by element id, and verifies with `screenshot`.

## Why it works well

- **Accessibility first, pixels second.** `get_app_state` returns the app's accessibility tree with stable element ids, so the agent presses _the button_ instead of guessing at a coordinate. It costs a fraction of the tokens of a screenshot and it is what scores highest on OSWorld-style tasks. Screenshots are for verifying and for content the tree cannot describe.
- **Background control.** Events are addressed to the target window (SkyLight on macOS, posted window messages on Windows, XTEST on Linux). No focus stealing, no hijacked mouse.
- **Pointer overlay, not your pointer.** A soft lavender agent pointer shows where the agent is acting. Your cursor is untouched.
- **Coordinates that land.** Every screenshot and zoom carries its screen origin and pixels-per-point. `zoom` captures any region at full physical resolution.
- **Your browser, your logins.** The Chrome extension gives the agent its own labelled tab group in your signed-in Chrome, and leaves your tabs alone unless you point it at one.
- **Or the tab you already have open.** `browser_list_tabs all=true` shows every tab in the browser and `browser_use_tab` takes one over in place — useful when the page is already signed in or mid-flow and re-opening the URL would throw that away. An adopted tab is not moved into the agent's group, not activated and not reloaded; cleanup releases it rather than closing it, and `browser_release_tab` hands it back early.
- **Model-agnostic.** No vision model is required for interaction; local models work too.
- **Look → act → verify.** `hover` for mouse-over menus, `wait` for loads, `query` to find a control by label without reading a whole tree.

Names, argument shapes and descriptions are identical on every platform; a model that learned them on a Mac needs nothing new on Windows.

## Repository layout

| Directory           | What                                                                   | Build                                                             |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `macos/`            | Swift server on the Accessibility API and ScreenCaptureKit (macOS 14+) | `swift build -c release` → `.build/release/munim-computer-use`          |
| `windows-linux/`    | Rust server: UI Automation on Windows, AT-SPI + X11 on Linux           | `cargo build --release` → `target/release/munim-computer-use`           |
| `chrome-extension/` | Chrome extension + native messaging host for the `browser_*` tools     | Load unpacked; `sh install.sh` / `install.ps1` registers the host; `node background.test.mjs` |

### Build from source

```sh
# macOS
cd macos && swift build -c release
# Windows / Linux
cd windows-linux && cargo build --release
```

Linux notes: element actions work everywhere; coordinate clicks need an X11 or XWayland client, since native Wayland apps do not expose absolute geometry.

### Chrome extension (optional)

1. `chrome://extensions` → Developer mode → **Load unpacked** → select `chrome-extension/`.
2. Register the native messaging host: `sh chrome-extension/install.sh` (macOS/Linux) or `powershell -File chrome-extension/install.ps1` (Windows). Point `COMPUTER_USE_PATH` at the binary if it is not in the default build location.

## Environment flags

| Variable                                   | Effect                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `COMPUTER_USE_BROWSER=0`                   | Hide the `browser_*` tools                                      |
| `COMPUTER_USE_AGENT_CURSOR=0`              | Do not draw the agent pointer                                   |
| `COMPUTER_USE_AGENT_CURSOR_TASK_FADE_SECS` | How long the pointer stays after the last tool call (default 8) |
| `COMPUTER_USE_ALLOW_SECURE_FIELD_INPUT=1`  | Allow typing into password fields (refused by default)          |
| `COMPUTER_USE_COMPUTER_USE_YIELD_SECS`     | Pause the agent while the user is actively using the machine    |

## Prompting your agent

Look → act → verify. `get_app_state` for ids, act by id, then `get_app_state` or `screenshot` again before the next step. Use `zoom` for small text, `hover` for menus that appear on mouse-over, `wait` after loads, keyboard shortcuts for stubborn widgets. The system-prompt text MT Code gives its agents lives in [`CodexDeveloperInstructions.ts`](https://github.com/munimtechnologies/mtcode/blob/main/apps/server/src/provider/CodexDeveloperInstructions.ts) and is a good starting point.

## Contributing

This repository mirrors the `native/` tree of [munimtechnologies/mtcode](https://github.com/munimtechnologies/mtcode), where the server is developed and shipped inside MT Code. Issues and discussions are welcome here; code changes land in mtcode first and are synced.
