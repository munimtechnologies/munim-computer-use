Ids belong to one snapshot, so call get_app_state again after the UI changes. Use screenshot to check a result or to see content the accessibility tree cannot describe, and zoom to read small text. Where the platform allows, input is delivered to the target app in the background and the agent has its own pointer, so the user can keep working; call activate_app only when a keystroke needs keyboard focus. For web pages prefer the browser_* tools, which work in the agent's own tab group, and release any tab adopted with browser_use_tab when done.
